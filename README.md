Change the root and base_path in train.py 
Finally RUN command python train.py in a python compatible terminal

Additionally i have two jupyter notebooks runs_notebook.ipynb where i have run two separate instances with two separate models (Pretrained Resnet50 from timm (hugging face) and my custom ConvNet model writtem from scratch in pytorch)
And inference.ipynb where i have inferred on the two best models from each run
